# SilverStripe Calendar

_by Title Web Solutions_

The calendar for SilverStripe 3.x is a solid base for all your calendaring needs, 
it's built to be flexible and configurable so that it fits to most scenarios - both for 
web sites with public events, and web apps with private events - or a combination hereof.

## NOTE

This was meant to be a premium module, but as of November 2014 we decided to open source it.

If you like it, and need help setting it up, we can do that for you.
[You can contact us here](http://title.dk/contact/).   
Below you'll find a wish list of features/amendmends we'd like to implement. If you miss a feature and/or
would like to sponsor development, we're happy to do so at a discounted rate - if so, 
please [contact us](http://title.dk/contact/).

**Pull requests are very welcome!** But please, get in touch with us if you're planning
to develop a feature.

## Demo

There's a demo site available on <http://calendar.demo.title.dk>.    
_On the demo site you can read more about the features, with practical examples._

The code for the demo is available at <https://github.com/titledk/silverstripe-calendar-demo>.    
If you plan to use the calendar, start out installing this!

## Compatibility

* For SilverStripe `3.1.x`: branch `1.0`
* For SilverStripe `3.2.x`: `master` / branch `1.1`

For tested versions check out the [Calendar demo](https://github.com/titledk/silverstripe-calendar-demo#compatibility)


## Live examples

The module is used on the following sites:

* <http://texasbeefcheckoff.com/resources/calendar/>
* <http://v2.bartonvilletc.com/events/>
* <http://cityofjustin.com/community/calendar/>

_Are you using this module on your site? Let us know!_

## Features

* Extensible. Customize it any way you want, while the basic concepts are taken care of.
* Solid, opinionated models.
* Event/Calendar/Category relations allowing complex filtering.
* Public/Private events.
* All features are configurable, so if you only need the basics, you can turn the rest off.
* Comprehensive calendar/event administration.
* JavaScript enhanced edit event form, usable both on frontend and backend, with date picker, 
time picker and dropdown, and duration dropdown, still allowing manual inputs
* Listing of events on the frontend through the CalendarPage
* Frontend calendar view, using the fullcalendar jQuery plugin
* Event Registrations (this might be moved to an external module)
* Calendar colors with configurable color options, and JS color palette field 
(works on both frontend and backend) - shading calendars allow for holiday calendars etc. to appear in the background
* No default frontend styling.
* Composer based workflow. Youâ€™ll be able to add and update the module using Composer.
* Define callback functions to override the custom behavior of an event in the frontend (mouseover, mouseout, click)

## Weak points at the moment

* The event model and administration is solid, but is missing recurring events
	* See the bottom of this readme file for our "wishlist"
* Frontend templates
	* The demo is overwriting much of the templates in the calendar
		* Includes should be more generic
	* preferably we should have a `Bootstrap` and a `Foundation` module
	for these
* Frontend styling
	* Would be nice with some easy-to-include Sass mixins
* Registrations

## Installation

Add at least the following to your project `_config.php`:

```php
CalendarConfig::init();
```

See `CalendarConfig` on how to configure the module.

### Event Callbacks

As mentioned above, you're able to add custom behavior for the mouseover, mouseout and click events of an event in the frontend. First you should create a custom theme for the calendar module in your themes folder (`/themes/<your-theme-name>_calendar/`). Now add a 'fullcalendar.js' file under `/themes/<your-theme-name>_calendar/js/`, with the following structure:

```javascript
;(function($) {
    // namespacing
    if($.fn.sscal === undefined) $.fn.sscal = {};
    
    // click callback
    $.fn.sscal.eventClick = function(event, jsEvent, view) {
        // your code
    }
    
    //
    //$.fn.sscal.eventMouseover = function(event, jsEvent, view);
    //$.fn.sscal.eventMouseout = function(event, jsEvent, view);
})($);
```

## Roadmap/Ideas/Plans



### Wish List

* Recurring events
* Unit tests
* Make everything translatable


### Possible Improvements

* Structure
	* consider using ss 3.1 config system
	* consider implementing the `EventInterface`, allowing everything to act as an event
	* hiding page types that are not enabled via the settings
		* see [here](http://www.balbus.tk/hide-a-page-from-the-cms-pagetype-dropdown/) for a reference
	* remove SS3.0 compatibility to make support for SS3.1 easier (make sure to make a tag w. SS3.0 compatibility)
* Backend
	* Implement event search in sidebar (see `CMSMAin->SearchForm()`)
	* Dashboard panel to display individual calendars' coming events, and jump to creation form
	* Backend usability review (together with concept review)
* Frontend
	* template structure
		* go through includes and layout templates and see how they fit as building blocks
	* Change `EventPage` to be a `DataExtension`, and call it `EventsPage`. (We might need an update script for this.)

## Versioning

We're trying to stick to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
paradigm. That is: 

> Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, 
backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes 
increment the major version.

So:

* Go for the `Master` branch, if you want to live on the edge
* Go for the latest version branch (e.g. `1.0`) if you want minor changes and patches
(choose the one that fit's your SilverStripe version, see above)
* Go for the tags (`1.0.0` and following), if you only want the actual releases
